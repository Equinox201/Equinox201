## About Me

I’m Nicolas, a 42 Singapore student transitioning from revenue strategy in hospitality into systems engineering and AI-driven software.

My focus is building strong foundations first:
- Writing memory-safe, predictable C code
- Understanding how software interacts with the OS
- Debugging at the process and file descriptor level
- Designing modular, testable architectures

Beyond 42, I’m building AI-powered systems and exploring the intersection of:
- Systems programming
- Backend architecture
- Intelligent agents
- Performance-critical applications

I value autonomy, clean architecture, and deeply understanding what happens under the hood.

## Technical Philosophy

I believe strong engineers understand what happens beneath the abstractions.
42’s low-level C curriculum trained me to think in terms of:
- Memory ownership
- File descriptors
- Process lifecycle
- Blocking vs non-blocking I/O
- Explicit error handling

Working under strict constraints (no external libraries, manual memory management, coding norms) forced clarity in architecture and discipline in implementation.

I prioritize:
- Predictable systems over clever hacks
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Defensive programming
- Reliability under edge cases

My goal is simple: build software that I fully understand - from the OS layer up to intelligent systems.
